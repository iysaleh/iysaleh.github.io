Hello!👋

So I wrote this dating app profile a little while back, and it turned out there was practically no-one using the app in my area (good for you all not using dating apps... They're absolute garbage!! 💩💩)

Anyways, I didn't want the write-up to go to waste so I saved it here -- and whaddy'a know, now you get to see it!😄

### Dating Profile Write-up

Boring dude here 👋

Cat cuddlers and animal lovers welcome!!! 😺 

Seeking future wifey!!!! 💍

I read books... I work out (not a gym rat by any means, but I run/bike/hike regularly-ish).... I wrench on my motorcycles and cars, and fix things around the house... I cook meals and bake desserts...

I acknowledge that I might not exactly be the 10/10 hot stud you normally swipe on, but maybe there's something else I could get ya to swoon over 🙃 ...

There's that old proverb -- "A man being rich is like a woman being pretty"... I'm ok with a bit of the gold digger mentality -- heck if you're loaded, I'd love that too! 🤪 --- I'm not old money rich, but I make $200k/yr in my job and have plenty of potential to grow. I own my own house, work fully remotely, and make sure to take time in life to be me. I make enough money for the essentials and more, don't waste your time working a dead end minimum wage job, be free to pursue your dreams and passions alongside me!!!!

What else is there, hmmm. Oh...

Please tell me you're comfortable squashing the 8-legged creepy crawlies 🕷️ --- tiny bit of arachnophobia here 🙋... I'm all good with snakes/worms/lizards though!!

Most people know me as the responsible guy you can count on that will never lie or cheat you...

I'll admit that I'm a bit of a homebody, but I do love the occasional outing! (hikes, restaurants, movies, traveling to Europe, etc -- ya know, basic stuff 🤪)

I believe in open communication, vulnerability, and building a relationship based on trust and mutual respect.

I'm seeking that special spark that ignites a loving, nurturing relationship that lasts as long as our hearts still beat ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

What is it that you're looking for?

Disclaimer: All of these fancy dating apps tinker with who you match with and how you match, but none of them resolve the problem of the disparity between our digital selves and our actual selves. No matter how much we talk, video chat, or w/e, when we meet in person, it'll be the first time we've ever met. In fact, the longer we keep our relationship digital, the more we'll disillusion ourselves about what we imagine each other to be... and we'll ultimately be disappointed. If you are willing to take a risk, let's meet up and find actual love.

### I think the world would be better off if:
dating apps didn't exist.

### Debate me
Robots replacing workers at Amazon warehouses with terrible working conditions is a future we should applaud and encourage! 

Expressing your honest opinion about someone's cooking, clothing, and habits neutrally and respectfully, can provide valuable feedback for improvement without causing offense and is healthy for a relationship.

### The quickest way to my heart is
Looking into each other's eyes, honesty, clearly reciprocating interest... 

Don't try to hold 20 conversations on here at once, you'll not only burn yourself out and get jaded looking for a relationship, but we'll get the impression you're not interested by the brevity and lameness of your responses. Converse with just one person you think might actually love you for who you are and want to grow old together with.
